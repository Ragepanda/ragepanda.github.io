                <!-- <img class="about-me-pic pull-left" src="assets/images/placeholder-profile.jpg"> -->
                <p> I am a Computer Science major from UNC Chapel Hill who is currently looking to enter the web development field.
                    Recently I was working as a quality assurance engineer on a utilities management software platform. I built a 
                    good deal of automated tests for webcrawling, SQL database verification and simulating protocol messages during my time there, but now desire 
                    to take on the challenge of being a web developer.
                </p>

                <p> I am currently enrolled in a Web Development boot camp to work on my skill set and receive professional training
                    to sharpen the web development skills I picked up at school and on the job. I have a solid set of projects demonstrating
                    my knowledge of web development, including a fair few from outside of the scope of the bootcamp. All of these projects can be found either on the portfolio
                    section, or on my Github account. 
                </p>
                <p> My desire for the next phase of my career is to find a work opportunity for any junior position in a web development team. I feel equally adept at and interested in 
                    front and back end development and ideally would get plenty of experience in both. This is because I want to build a strong, well rounded skill set so that I can 
                    direct my career towards being a senior developer in charge of a team or even towards an entrepreneurial venture. No matter which direction I choose for my career,
                    my highest priorities are opportunities to develop my skills, mentorship, work-life balance and a highly collaborative environment.
