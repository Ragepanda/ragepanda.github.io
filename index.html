                <p> They say that Kanye West was God's gift to the 20th Century. I plan on being God's gift to the 3rd millenia. Hello Earthlings, my name is John Woltz and you <em>will</em> hire me..... Or else.</p>
                <p> I have the skills necessary to do it all. Political Elections, Stock Markets, Satellite Radio Hijacks, Key Genning Free World of Warcraft subscription codes, mastery of MS paint, you name it and I can do it, easy. Do you really want talent like this working for the competition and against you? Consider carefully.</p>
                <p> I am a certified Web Developer, who can work in a fast paced environemnt, has strong communication skills, will bring free breakfast to the office every Monday for my first year, works well alone or with others and am the greatest hacker in the universe. I can even hack time, just get me the uplink into the downstream. </p>
